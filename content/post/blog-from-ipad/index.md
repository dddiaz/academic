# Hi There

It has been a while since I have posted on my blog, so I asked myself whats kept me from posting.
Well I have been insanely busy with my new job at Illumina working on Top Secret Projects, but other than that, whats kept me from posting.
Well I have also been trying to work out more and spend more time outside, but other than that, whats kept me from posting.
Well my sister just had her second baby (ðŸ¥³) so I have been trying to focus more on uncle duties, but other than that, whats kept me from posting.

I know what it is, its the fact that I can't update my blog from my iPad! Yes... Thats it... the iPad factor.

Happy to say, today that is fixed!
