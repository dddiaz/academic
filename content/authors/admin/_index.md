I am a Computer Science(B.S.) and Political Science(B.A.) graduate from the University of California, Irvine.
I love to solve impactful problems - I specialize in Genomics, Python applications, and Cloud Infrastructure.
I am currently a Staff Bioinformatics Engineer in Product Development at Illumina.
When I am not coding you might find me sailing, traveling, cycling, or volunteering with a Diabetes non-profit.
