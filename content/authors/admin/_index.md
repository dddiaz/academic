I am a Computer Science(B.S.) and Political Science(B.A.) graduate from the University of California, Irvine. 

I love to code - I specialize in python applications, Infrastructure as Code, and DevSecOps. When I am not coding you might find me sailing, traveling, cycling, or volunteering with JDRF.
